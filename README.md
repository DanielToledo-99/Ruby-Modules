# Instructions

Today's assignment consists of 2 ruby exercises. Each exercise has their own
directory:

- 20animals
- 21warriors

Inside each directory are 3 files: `exercise_name.rb`, `exercise_name_test.rb`
and `instructions.md`.

Following the instructions you need to modify the file `exercise_name.rb` so the
tests will pass.
